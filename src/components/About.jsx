          I am a third-year Computer Science student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology with a strong passion 
          for software development. My academic journey has provided me with a solid technical foundation and a curiosity for
           exploring new technologies. I continuously seek opportunities to improve my skills through hands-on projects and real-world challenges. 
           With a commitment to learning and building meaningful software, I aim to develop user-focused, practical solutions that make a positive impact.
